Tired of clicking endlessly to sort or enable/disable mods? Use this mod to pin to the top, pin to the bottom, enable, or disable with just one click! A restart is required the first time you enable it.

[h2] ⚙️ 2. Features [/h2]
[list]
    [*] Added two buttons for each item in the MOD management page to move the mod to the top or bottom, effectively equivalent to pressing the up/down button multiple times
    [*] A checkbox is added on the left side of the MOD entry. Checking the box enables all mods, while unchecking it disables all mods.

[h2] 🔔 3. Notes [/h2]
[list]
    [*] This mod can be safely uninstalled and will not affect your save files
    [*] A restart is required the first time the mod is activated
    [*] This mod does not depend on any prerequisites, but if you're using a Mac and have subscribed to the Harmony.lib mod which prevents this mod from working, try moving this mod above it in the load order
    [*] The principle behind enabling/disabling all mods is to enable them sequentially from the first mod entry downwards. It is normal to experience a brief delay if there are too many mod entries.
    [*] If you want to disable all mods but notice the checkbox is not checked, please check the box first.

[list]
    [*] This mod modifies the MOD menu UI, which may conflict with other mods that modify the same UI
    [*] This mod uses the Harmony framework, so it may conflict with other mods that also use Harmony
    [*] This mod makes extensive use of reflection, and it may become outdated with future game updates
