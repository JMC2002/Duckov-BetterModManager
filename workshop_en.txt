[h1]Better MOD Manager[/h1]
[h2] 🧠 1. Introduction [/h2]
Tired of clicking endlessly to sort or enable/disable mods? Use this mod to pin to the top, pin to the bottom, enable, or disable with just one click! It also supports dragging and sorting of items. A restart is required the first time you enable it.

[h2] ⚙️ 2. Features [/h2]
[list]
    [*] Added two buttons for each item in the MOD management page to move the mod to the top or bottom, effectively equivalent to pressing the up/down button multiple times
    [*] A checkbox is added on the left side of the MOD entry. Checking the box enables all mods, while unchecking it disables all mods.
    [*] Hold the mouse button on a mod entry to drag and reorder it.
    [*] Click a mod entry to select it, then press [b]W[/b] or the up arrow key to move the mod up, [b]S[/b] or the down arrow key to move it down, and press [b]Enter[/b], [b]ESC[/b], or click anywhere to deselect.
    [*] You can now scroll the interface by dragging with the right mouse button (same behavior as left-click dragging without mods).

[h2] 🔔 3. Notes [/h2]
[list]
    [*] This mod can be safely uninstalled and will not affect your save files
    [*] A restart is required the first time the mod is activated
    [*] This mod does not depend on any prerequisites, but if you're using a Mac and have subscribed to the Harmony.lib mod which prevents this mod from working, try moving this mod above it in the load order
    [*] The principle behind enabling/disabling all mods is to enable them sequentially from the first mod entry downwards. It is normal to experience a brief delay if there are too many mod entries.
    [*] If you want to disable all mods but notice the checkbox is not checked, please check the box first.
