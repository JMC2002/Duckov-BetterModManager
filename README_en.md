# Better MOD Manager

## 0. Installation
For the Steam version, simply subscribe on the Workshop 👉 [Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3600174953)

For other versions, you can compile it yourself or download the BetterModManager.zip from the [📦 Releases](https://github.com/JMC2002/Duckov-BetterModManager/releases) page, and extract it into the "Mods" folder in the game installation directory (create the folder if it doesn’t exist). The file structure will look like this:

```sh
-- Escape from Duckov
    |-- Duckov.exe
    |-- Duckov_Data
         |-- Mods
              |-- BetterModManager
                   |-- 0Harmony.dll
                   |-- BetterModManager.dll
                   |-- info.ini
                   |-- preview.png
> ⚠️ The release page will update with Workshop changes. The latest version is based on the source code. The DLL in the project folder is the latest, but it may not be usable during development.

## 🧠 1. Introduction
Tired of clicking endlessly to sort your mods? Use this mod to pin to the top or bottom with one click! A restart is required for the first use.

## ⚙️ 2. Features
- Added two buttons for each item in the MOD management page to move the mod to the top or bottom, effectively equivalent to pressing the up/down button multiple times.

## 🔔 3. Notes
- This mod can be safely uninstalled and will not affect your save files.
- A restart is required the first time the mod is activated.
- This mod does not depend on any prerequisites, but if you're using a Mac and have subscribed to the Harmony.lib mod which prevents this mod from working, try moving this mod above it in the load order.

## 🧩 4. Compatibility
- This mod modifies the MOD menu UI, which may conflict with other mods that modify the same UI.
- This mod uses the Harmony framework, so it may conflict with other mods that also use Harmony.
- This mod makes extensive use of reflection, and it may become outdated with future game updates.

## 🧭 5. TODO
- Add a one-click select/deselect all feature.
